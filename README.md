Project report 
ðŸ“Š Project Overview:-
The Zomato Sales Analysis Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project built using Tableau to analyze restaurant trends across multiple countries and cities.
The goal is to explore restaurant distribution, customer ratings, cuisines, online delivery adoption, and booking behavior â€” all in one visual dashboard.
By transforming raw Zomato data into meaningful visuals, this project delivers data-driven insights that help businesses and analysts understand restaurant performance and customer preferences globally.

ðŸ§© Data Modeling Process:-
Data modeling was designed in Tableau to connect and organize relationships between multiple datasets.
Model Design:
Primary Table: Restaurant information (Restaurant ID, Name, Country, City, Cuisines, Votes, Ratings, Price Range).
Supporting Tables:
Country Table â€“ Contains country names and codes.
Date Table â€“ Created to support yearly, quarterly, and monthly trend analysis.
Joins & Relationships:
Linked Country Code to the Country Table.
Connected date fields for time-based trend analysis.
Calculated Fields Created in Tableau:
Average Ratings = AVG([Rating])
Total Votes = SUM([Votes])
Restaurant Count = COUNTD([Restaurant ID])
% of Online Delivery = (COUNT(IF [Has Online Delivery] = "Yes" THEN 1 END)) / COUNT([Restaurant ID])
% of Table Booking = (COUNT(IF [Has Table Booking] = "Yes" THEN 1 END)) / COUNT([Restaurant ID])
This model allows dynamic filtering and multi-level insights across years, quarters, and countries.
